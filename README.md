## The life energy - the source of proactive
We do not force people! We cultivate life energy!

Energy is like gas for car. If it is fulfilling, the car can run very fast. If it is exhausting, the car cannot run fast. Forcing for a long time depletes life energy, very unstable engine. Thus, to be proactive, we should cultivate even more life energy instead of forcing. The more life energy there is, the more proactive!

There are three sources of life energy. These should be slowly cultivated over time through proper workloads and enough resting.
1. Body energy: keeps us from sickness, leads to wellness
2. Heart energy: keeps us from psychosis, leads to happiness
3. Mind energy: keeps us from confusion, leads to clearness
