  Many dreams of spectacular career success and happiness wild beyond the universe. Unbeknown to them, such dreams demand **extremely efficient** utilization of life energy, for **maximum** results. The signal-to-noise ratio has to be 100%, only the like of Uncle Ho, Elon Musk, ... can attain such feats. Constant change in heart and mind to more efficient ways is required.

Working more on a 10-step job may yield more results, but it is limited by 24 hours/day. Mindset change to 5-step job can overcome the time constraint and lead to double the result. Here lies the hardest part! Anyone will logically choose to change from 10-step to 5-step. But, emotionally, are they willing to admit that they are stupid and someone else is better? Are they willing to experiment the new 5-step, and abandoning the already working 10-step? Are they willing to try out the new 5-step, when everyone else is doing the 10-step?
  
Change is hardest in emotions, as it invokes the deepest fears. Fear of losing what we have, fear of shame, fear of going against what is perceived as normal. If one never dares to touch their fear barriers, how can one change? But, fear is also conditioned to scare people away from the barriers, crippling ability to discover better mindsets. This conflicting nature of Fear-to-Change keeps people in the loop, never realize what is beyond their loop.

Only at critical energy-deplete moments (depressed), the body activates change mechanism to survive. This seems to be the natural way of breaking the fear loop. By actively pushing to the limits instead of waiting, we can achieve much quicker change. Limit breaker!

The brain-dead way of jumping into shit holes to force our body to change can lead to life-scarring trauma, as I have experienced many times. Can we attempt to poke the limits with plans and better community support? Less trauma, more changes. Buddhism is successful in this with practitioners reaching Enlightenment.
