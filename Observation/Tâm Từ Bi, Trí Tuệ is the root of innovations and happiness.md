"What is the root of innovations?"
"What is the root of happiness?"

The root problem that have bugged me for 10 years, and became concrete since the beginning of 2025 when my mind was exposed to the enlightened mind of Great Masters. Brother Cuong told that the goal of Buddhism is to "end sufferings, cultivate joy", and the goal of Buddhist is to evolve infinitely "Tâm Từ Bi", "Trí Tuệ". I didn't understand them at first and how they can help answer the two questions above, Brother Cuong told me to observe more deeply.

Through various critical thought experiments for six months and help from Brother Cuong for the most critical problem crux, I have finally realized how "Tâm Từ Bi", "Trí Tuệ" is the root of innovations and happiness. With this realization, I intend to observe and practice more deeply to uncover the detailed pathways toward innovations and happiness.

The methodology:
1. Understand the root meaning of "Tâm Từ Bi", "Trí Tuệ".
2. How "Tâm Từ Bi", "Trí Tuệ" drives innovations?
3. How "Tâm Từ Bi", "Trí Tuệ" drives happiness?

## I. The root meaning of "Tâm Từ Bi", "Trí Tuệ"
1. Tâm Từ: love to help everyone cultivate joy
2. Tâm Bi: love to help everyone lessen sufferings
3. Trí Tuệ: love to observe deeply to see true nature

Everyone includes both ourselves and others. First help ourselves, then help others. Help from a loving person, is very different from a suffering person. A person with lesser sufferings can help a person with more sufferings, can't help a person with more joy.

## II. How "Tâm Từ Bi", "Trí Tuệ" drives innovations?
Innovations are our responses to much sufferings (diseases, threats, risks, ...), or our wish to cultivate more joy (games, entertainment, social network, ...)
1. Cultivate joy category: Games, Entertainment, Social Network, ...
2. Lessen sufferings category: Medicines, Chips, Internet, ...

When "Tâm Từ Bi" is greater than the existing limits of surroundings, innovators tend to break that limits to create a new reality matching their vision. They break limits with innovations.

How to realize that innovations? "Trí Tuệ" is needed here to gain foresights, hindsights, and insights. Through deep observation of the expected state, the past state, the current state, one can create an actionable plan to inherit the past, change the now, and lead to the future.

## III. How "Tâm Từ Bi", "Trí Tuệ" drives happiness?
Happiness is the resulting state of joy. A lot of joy leads to a lot of happiness, a lot of sufferings leads to a lot of depression. Joy can come from either "less sufferings" or "more joy".

Todo: I can't write much on joy here, as I have not achieved that higher level of joy yet. This is an area in need of discovery. All I can reason is that "Tâm Từ Bi" and "Trí Tuệ" must exist both to attain evolving happiness, else it will be temporary happiness. Need more observation!
